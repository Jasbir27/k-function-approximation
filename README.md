# k-function-approximation
You are required to implement "function approximation" dynamic programming algorithm that was discussed in the class (Section 5.4 of the draft).
## Input format
&lt;k&gt;  &lt;errorType&gt;  
&lt;number Of Input Points&gt;  
&lt;point_x1&gt; &lt;point_y1&gt;  
&lt;point_x2&gt; &lt;point_y2&gt;  
&lt;point_x3&gt; &lt;point_y3&gt;  
.  
.  
.  
&lt;point_xN&gt; &lt;point_yN&gt;  

The first line gives 2 integers, the number of levels allowed in the step and type of error function  
The second line contains number of points (say N)  
The next N lines contain x-coordinate of each point followed by y-coordinate
